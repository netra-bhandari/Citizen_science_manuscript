A study to analyse citizen science survey data and understand how people record different species observations.

## Scripts

In this folder the main scripts are - 
1. processing.R - a script to clean the raw data and align the different taxa questions in the same columns (work in progress)
2. pca.R - PCA analysis for selected focal taxa
3. correlations.R - a script to explore pair-wise correlations
4. final_graphs.R - script to produce the likert and bar graphs (e.g. Figs 1 and 2 in the paper)
5. survey_effort_trap.R - script to explore variation in effort and the traps
6. questions.R - a script to run the models that test the specific questions (not needed for paper)
